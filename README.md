COSMICS - A Browser Multiplayer Game
http://yo-code.de/cosmics

You are a hero and must save the world from cosmic alien invaders. There can be only one hero at a time. If there are more aspirants they have to queue up as spectators.
Each spectator can help with balloons to fight the invaders (or irritate the hero) and must try to stay alive. A dying spectator means to fall back to the taillight of the next hero queue.

----------------------------------
### Client

The client consists of a hero-, a spectator- or a solo hero game.
If there is no server available the solo client game will start.
The solo client game features only simulator-like graphics and no score.
